So I'm exploring possible software solutions, in the form of a pilot project, to treat and analyse neutron
data.<br />Although, for now, no decisions have been taken, I do feel that we have to provide (only?) a web interface,
in the form of a rich HTML5 internet application.<br /><br />There's not many (if any) scientific internet applications:
Well, something with 3D and 2D plotting facilities and a&nbsp;scripting console for math operations
(a&nbsp;restricted/safe&nbsp;ipython console being the ideal). Looking forward for suggestions :)<br /><br />Coming back
to the main subject: tablets and smartphones market will explode in the coming years: <br /><br /><img

a great presentation about this topic available on the Business Insider web site:<br /><a

interesting to see in this presentation that app developers still&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;iOS to Android! Even worse they might
be loosing interest in Android! <br />And I though Java was easier and more intuitive than ObjectC !?!?!?!&nbsp;
<br />Android version fragmentation appears to be the source of the problems..<br /><br />For the capitalists out there,
the cross-platform&nbsp;revenue is 3 times higher with iOS than with Android: `"iOS is where the money is"!<br /><br />I
do believe that we will all be using a browser and HTML5 in future. Well, let's see!<br /><br />
