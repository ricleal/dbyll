I'm in the middle of designing a new architecture for scientific applications and came across this
"<i>mine</i>".&nbsp;Just had a pic, but looks something to add to my bookshelf.<br /><br />Like the authors say:
&nbsp;Developers "<i>repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.</i>" (Where have I
heard this before?).<br /><br />Topics discussed for roughly 50 applications:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>How open source applications&nbsp;are structured, and why.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>What are each program's major components?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>How do they interact?&nbsp;</li>
    <li>And what did their builders learn during their development?</li>
</ul><br />
