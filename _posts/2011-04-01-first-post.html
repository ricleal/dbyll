Just finished my post-doc!<br />
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'm "<i>living on the doll</i>" with some free time (still finishing a few articles though!) and decided that it's
    time to create a blog!<br />
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>My job applications are leaning towards object design and IT architectures in the context of science. It would
        just be a waste for me to give up science after a PhD in Physics and a PostDoc in Bio-Physics.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>I will be mainly writting about what I'm discovering and learning. I bet things have changed a lot in lasst 7
        years. Last time I was involved in a serious IT project Struts and CMP 2.0 were hard-core technology!</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>I hope I can share my journey towards the new world of IT.<br />
